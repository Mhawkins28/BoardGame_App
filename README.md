## About The Project
live demo on Heroku -- 

My first Full-stack application. It is a a full CRUD app using Node.js, MangoDb/Mongoose, Express and EJS.

This app will be perfect for any board game enthusiast out there! This application will allow the user to store all the boardgames in their arsenal so that they can keep track of them and be ready for any game night or party. There will be flexibility to create, edit, or delete games, making this application unique to each user!

## User stories

### MVP

- As the user, I want to have a well-designed, clean interface that is easy to understand and navigate.
- As the user, I want multiple pages to see and/or organize the data that is entered. (CRUD routes)
- As the user, I want to add as many boardgames to the collection as I would like.
- As the user, I want to add an image of the game. (either with URL or multer. Need to research)
- As the user, I want to add a description, list how many players can play, the average playtime of each game, and the game category. 
- As the user, I want the game category options in dropdown list.
- As the user, I want to edit or delete the entries I put in the collection.
- As the user, I want to add reviews and ratings on each game.
- As the user, I want to edit or delete the reviews and ratings.

### Stretch Goals

- As the user, I would like a Homepage with User authentication/login.
- As the user, with a login, I want to have my personal game collection with all the MVP goals attached to that profile.
- As the user, I would like to filter my collection by rating, number of players, playtime, or category.
- As the user, I would like access a database of existing games and use that data for my entries.
- As the user, I would like to add games to a Wishlist page.
- As the user, regarding the Wishlist, I would like the option to link buying options.
- As the user, regarding the Wishlist, I would like to prioritize my wishlist.
- As the user, I would like to have the option to archive the games in my collection (purpose: if I no longer have a game, but do not wish to fully delete it from my virtual collection yet)
- As the user, I would like to post entries and/or access a global forum or game review board to see the averaged ratings.
- As the user, I would like to have a unique page that displays the games on a bookshelf and have the names/links to show page in the shape of game board boxes on the shelf.
- As the user, I would like interesting, smooth page transition animations (SWUP?)
